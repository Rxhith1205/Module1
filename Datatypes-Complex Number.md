# Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## Program
Add Code Here
```python
real = int(input("Enter the real part: "))
imag = int(input("Enter the imaginary part: "))

z = complex(real, imag)

print("Complex Number:", z)
print("Real Part:", z.real)
print("Imaginary Part:", z.imag)

```
## Output

## Result
Hence the program is executed successfully.
